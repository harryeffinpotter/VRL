# VRL - VR Launcher
## A utility for PCVR users.

VRL is ESPECIALLY useful for those of us who have an Oculus Quest 1/2 + the paid [Virtual Desktop app by Guy Godin](https://github.com/guygodin/VirtualDesktop).
Why? Because when you use VRL + VD it is possible to run PCVR titles WITHOUT either SteamVR OR Oculus Desktop app running! Completely native with just a few background runtimes!!


**Here's how we get this to happen:**
1. In the Oculus Desktop app go to Settings and change your Default VR Runtime to OpenXR.
2. Run VRL and select the PARENT DIRECTORY of a game you wish to try it on.
3. Check the box for Virtual Desktop on VRL.
4. Make the shortcuts.
5. Exit SteamVR + Oculus app.
6. Connect to your PC via Virtual Desktop
7. Find the newly created shortcut (the one that has VD in the title), and either set your headset down for a moment and double click the shortcut, 
or use the B/Y button to right click on the shortcut then select Open, or simply double click with the Touch controller trigger.

**Once you've done all of this one of two things will happen.**
- SteamVR will launch and open the PCVR application.
  **- or -**
- The PCVR application will launch natively.

Either scenario preforms better than with Oculus Desktop app open. For some reason this also fixes a plethora of compatibility issues, such as games like The Walking Dead 
only loading with Vive Wands for whatever reason, VRL fixes this. I use VRL for all of the games I own just beacuse it seems to be far more consistent at getting
games to launch in the headset and not in 2d. It just works, I don't know the exact science behind it, but it works. I did ask Guy Godin himself why this method works
so well a few years ago and he alluded to the fact that Oculus forces him to attatch their runtimes to any exe launched via VD, even with the Inject feature. I don't
know if things have changed since then but VRL + VD is still the de facto way to use Virtual Desktop with an Oculus Quest, in my opinion, so if you use VD on your
Quest 1/2, give VRL a shot, you won't regret it!
